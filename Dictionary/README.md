# Dictionary Application Documentation
## Introduction
### This project is part of a dictionary application developed using C# and WPF (.NET Framework). The application consists of three modules: Administrative, Word Search, and Entertainment.

### Description
#### The Entertainment Module of the dictionary application provides users with a fun and engaging word guessing game. The game challenges users to guess five words from the dictionary within a limited number of attempts.

### Features
#### - Word Guessing Game: Users are presented with five random words from the dictionary. They must guess each word correctly to proceed.
#### - Random Word Selection: The game selects five random words from the dictionary to ensure variety and unpredictability.
#### - Hint Mechanism: For each word, users receive a hint in the form of either a description or an image. If the word does not have an associated image, only the description is displayed.
#### - Interactive Interface: Users can navigate between words using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons. Once all words are guessed or the user finishes the game, the interface resets for a new round.
#### - Scoring System: The module tracks the number of correct guesses made by the user and displays the score at the end of the game.
### Game Flow
#### Word Selection: Five random words are selected from the dictionary.
#### Hint Display: For each word, a hint (description or image) is displayed.
#### User Guess: Users input their guess for each word.
#### Feedback: After each guess, users receive immediate feedback on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
#### Next Word: Users can navigate to the next word using the "Next" button.
#### Game Completion: Once all words are guessed or the user finishes the game, the final score is displayed.
## Conclusion
#### The Entertainment Module adds an element of fun and challenge to the dictionary application. By engaging users in a word guessing game, it provides an interactive way to explore and learn from the dictionary's content.
